			<h1>Nuttyverse</h1>

			<p>
				Ahoy there, fellow navigator! Welcome to my internet expanse. You
				might notice a seeming emptiness, but do not fret. You've simply
				arrived early enough to witness the expansion of this universe.
			</p>

			<p>
				Just as the <strong>physical</strong> universe materialized from the
				Big Bang, this website will similarly unfold from this point.
				Emerging from this singularity will bloom a new
				<strong>digital</strong> universe.
