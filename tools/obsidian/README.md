# Obsidian

```bash
ln -s ~/Code/nuttyverse/tools/obsidian ~/Documents/Notes/.obsidian/themes/Nutty
```

Note: It is important that the symbolic link name matches the value of the `name` field in `manifest.json`. Otherwise, Obsidian will not recognize the theme in **Settings -> Appearances -> Theme**.
